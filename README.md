# Traffic-Sim
### This program creates a GUI that creates a simulation of a traffic intersection with buttons that allow the user to start, stop, pause, or add more intersections and cars to the simulation. The GUI displays squares to represent cars, circles to represent stoplights, and displays the distance and speed below the "cars".

><h1>Object-Oriented and Concurrent Programming</h1>
><h2>CMCS 335</h2>
><p>A study of object-oriented and concurrent programming using features of Java. The goal is to design, implement, test, debug, and document complex robust programs in an object-oriented language. Concepts of object-oriented programming (such as composition, classification, and polymorphism) are explored. Topics include the principles of concurrent programming (such as task synchronization, race conditions, deadlock, threads, and event-driven graphic user interface programs). Programming projects are implemented in Java.</p>
